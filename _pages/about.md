I am currently a master student at Department of Computer Science, ETH ZÃ¼rich, conducting master thesis under the supervision of Prof. Siyu Tang. In 2019, I interned at [JD AI Research](https://air.jd.com/), where I was lucky enough to work with Dr. Tong shen, Dr. Wei Zhang and Dr. Tao Mei. During graduate school, I also worked closely with Yuhua Chen and Prof. Wen Li at [Computer Vision Lab](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/en/). Before coming to Switzerland, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Sichuan University, China in 2017. And even before that, I attended Beijing No.4 High School in Beijing, China.

My research interests include computer vision and computer graphics. I have some experience in domain adaptive object detction and semantic segmentation, but I am also open to other topics. Currently I am actively seeking Ph.D positions at 2020 Fall.
