I am currently a master student at Department of Computer Science, [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), conducting master thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Siyu Tang](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/stang). In 2019, I interned at [JD AI Research](https://air.jd.com/), where I was lucky enough to work with [Dr. Tong shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kBnw1ogAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Wei Zhang](http://wzhang.fun/) and [Dr. Tao Mei](https://taomei.me/). During graduate school, I also worked closely with [Yuhua Chen](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~yuhchen/) and [Prof. Wen Li](https://wenli-vision.github.io/) at [Computer Vision Lab](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/en/). Before coming to Switzerland, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science at [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/), China in 2017. And even before that, I attended [Beijing No.4 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_No._4_High_School) in Beijing, China.

My research interests include computer vision and computer graphics. I have some experience in domain adaptive object detction and domain adaptive semantic segmentation, but I am also open to other topics. Currently I am actively seeking Ph.D positions at 2020 Fall.
