I am currently a master student at Department of Computer Science, [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). Before coming to Switzerland, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science at [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/), China in 2017. And even before that, I attended [Beijing No.4 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_No._4_High_School) in Beijing, China.

My research interests include computer vision and computer graphics. I have some experience in domain adaptive object detction and domain adaptive semantic segmentation, but I am also open to other topics. **Currently I am actively seeking Ph.D positions starting from 2021.**
